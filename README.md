## Installation

### **Verifying the checksums**

It's recommended that you verify the checksums before using Archer.

On Linux, this is a very simple thing to do.
Run the following command in a terminal:

`sha256sum -c archer-(version)-(architecture).iso.sha256sum`

If the image (ISO file) was fully and correctly downloaded you should see something like this:

`archer-1.0.5-x86_64.iso: OK`

On Windows you have to get some external tools.
An example is [sha256sum.exe](http://www.labtestproject.com/files/win/sha256sum/sha256sum.exe), which you can run in cmd like so:

`sha256sum.exe archer-(version)-(architecture).iso`

Note that unlike its Linux counterpart, it will only display the sha256 checksum of the image,
not compare it with the generated checksums as well.
So make sure to open the .sha256sum file in a text editor and compare the hashes yourself.

### **Windows**

The best tool to flash Archer Linux to a USB is [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).
Download it, choose the Archer image (ISO), select the wanted USB and press write.

THIS WILL COMPLETELY WIPE YOUR USB! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

### **Linux**

The fastest method, although not the safest or easiest for most beginners is to use `dd`.

DON'T COPY AND PASTE THE TEXT BELOW AS ANY DISK YOU SELECT WILL BE COMPLETELY WIPED!

Replace `x` with your USB device's letter (use `lsblk` to check which letter it was assigned, usually it's "b"):

```
sudo dd if=./<archer-image.iso> of=/dev/sdx bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

You can also use GUI based software such as [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
